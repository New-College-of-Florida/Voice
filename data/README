Here's an overview of the overview.

Overview of Overview

The code (in notebooks) on dsgpu04 currently writes to /Akamai/voice/data
or /Akamai/voice/html/georgian/data.
Neither of these directories is in a github repo
Most of the data we want in github needs to be in .../html/georgian/data, so
it is copied over to the corresponding path in a repo (currently /Akamai/voice/David/...).

Exception:
 - the notebooks write the *notes_shifted.txt files to /Akamai/voice/data/pitches-postprocessed
   but they are copied to .../David/html/georgian/data/pitches-postprocessed
   (pending changes to the notebooks...)
   
Here's a brief overview of the dataflow, followed by a detailed description.

Overview

Here are the subdirectories of /Akamai/voice/data (or  /Akamai/voice/html/georgian/data)
and the data flow:

pitches-raw: output of each algorithm, input to algorithm alignment

pitches: output of algorithm alignment, input to voiced-unvoiced

pitches-vuv: output of voiced-unvoiced

pitches-vuv-new:
- manual pitch deletions, usually just to Crepe (the best algo), using pitch tool

Pitch Tool/Delete Pitches and Correct Octaves (formerly Tool):
  pitches-vuv-new -> pitches-vuv-new: manual corrections to Crepe

Pitch Tool/Override Pitches and Postprocess:
  pitches-vuv-new -> pitches-vuv-new
                  -> pitch-overrides
					   
pitch-overrides:
- manual pitch range boxes used to override Crepe and as advice to other algos

pitches-postprocessed:
- manual pitch overrides (and more deletions), usually just to Crepe  

pitches-raw-crepe-assisted: output of each algorithm, limited to within 20% of Crepe,
                            input to algorithm alignment (BUG - should be aligned first)

pitches-crepe-assisted: output of algorithm alignment, input to voiced-unvoiced

pitches-vuv-crepe-assisted: output of voiced-unvoiced
  
polyphony/Ground Truth Determiner and Statistical Analysis:
  pitches-postprocessed (Crepe)
  pitches-vuv-crepe-assisted (other algos) -> ground-estimate (final pitch estimates)
                                           -> ground-estimate-statistics (std, mean, median, mad)

ground-estimate-rfr: unused; was for Random Forest Regressor

Up to this point, all processing is per-voice.
Now the voices aligned with each other

ground-estimate/<collection>/<song>/shifts.txt: hand-made shift amounts for each voice

post individual vocal shifts/Shift Songs.ipynb
  shifts.txt
  <voice>.txt -> <voice>_shifted.txt (in various folders)
              -> <shifted override box files>
	      -> <shifted mad files>

Detailed Description

!? All the raw and processed data is in /Akamai/voice/data.
   This is confusing because that directory does not have .git, but some data has been committed (from somewhere).

   Comments:
   - aligns pitches from different algorithms, for each voice separately; does not align voices to each other
   - no masking of unvoiced "pitches"

   Depends on: 2, 3
   Output: /Akamai/voice/data/pitches-vuv/<algo short name>/<collection>/<song>/<voice>.txt
   Comments:
   - masks unvoiced "pitches" using the output of the voiced/unvoiced algorithm
   - does not align voices to each other

   Notebook: -- (linux shell command)
   Depends on: 4
   Output: /Akamai/voice/data/pitches-vuv/<algo short name>/<collection>/<song>/<voice>.txt
   Comments:
   - cp
   - copies files to a new directory where they'll be processed in place

!! From this point on the notebooks assume there is a "target algorithm" that is best (it's Crepe),
   and they help the user improve the target algorithm's pitch estimates.
   They let the user refer to other algorithms' pitch estimates where Crepe's estimate looks bad.

   Notebook: /Akamai/voice/David/notebooks/Pitch Tool/Delete Pitches and Correct Octaves.ipynb
   Depends on: 5, 6 (itself, since the user can reuse this script)
   Output: /Akamai/voice/data/pitches-vuv-new/crepe/<collection>/<song>/<voice>.txt
   Comments:
   - works on files in place
   - first stage of manual pitch overrides:
     - can correct
       - Crepe (target algo) pitches that should be 0 (usually another voice is singing)
       - Crepe (target algo) pitches for which another algorithm has a better estimate (in another octave)
     - cannot correct
       - consonants that show up as 0's or other pitches (usually no algorithm has a good estimate)
       - pitches in the wrong octave but for which no algorithm has a good estimate in the right octave
       - pitches in the right octave that sound wrong 
     - calculates "notes" for use in this notebook, but the notes are not saved
     - can "postprocess":
       - un-zeroes isolated 0's
       - sets any pitches that don't belong to notes or between-note rises or falls to -1
   - works on each voice separately; does not align voices to each other
   
7. Input:  /Akamai/voice/data/pitches-vuv-new/<algo short name>/<collection>/<song>/<voice>.txt
   Notebook: /Akamai/voice/David/notebooks/Pitch Tool/Override Pitches and Postprocess.ipynb
   Depends on: 6, 7 (itself, since the user can reuse this script)
   Output: /Akamai/voice/data/pitches-postprocessed/crepe/<collection>/<song>/<voice>.txt
           /Akamai/voice/data/pitch-overrides/crepe/<collection>/<song>/<voice>.txt
   Comments:
      This tool is used to create pitch-override boxes and to use note-detection to postprocess the Crepe pitch estimates.

      Pitch-Override Boxes
      	     The user creates one or more pitch-override boxes for each voice of each song.
	     The tool writes the pitch-override boxes to /Akamai/voices/data/pitch-overrides.

             Each pitch-override box defines a min and max pitch in a range of time steps,
	     as guidance for the other algorithms.

      Adding Notes
      	     In a section where the Crepe note is 0 the user can select either crepe pitches or note pitches.
	     The tool will add a note whose pitch is the average of the Crepe pitches

      Postprocessing
             Post-processing sets to 0 all pitches whose note value is 0 and sets negative note values to -1.
	     Generally long runs of nonzero pitches of indeterminate note are assigned a note of 0;
	     this means either there is silence or (when there is an override box)
	     Crepe's estimate should not be considered for the final estimate.
	     Shorter runs between notes are assigned a negative note value;
	     this means Crepe should not be used as guidance for the other algorithms
	     but Crepe's estimate should be considered.

      Usage
             On each song, the user should

                   Run the manual override tool (6) on each voice to check it's ready for pitch-override and postprocessing.
		   Make pitch-override boxes for all three voices.
		   Toggle a 0 note to negative or vice-versa. See "Postprocessing" above.
		   Add notes and save the note files. (One click saves the currently visible voice notes.)
		   Postprocess all three voices. (One click postprocesses the currently visible voice.)
		   Save all three voices. (One click saves the currently visible voice.)

      The postprocessed pitch estimates and notes are saved to /Akamai/voices/data/pitches-postprocessed.
      The note files have the same format (timestamp pitch) as the pitch files.
      The override boxes are saved to /Akamai/voices/data/pitch-overrides.

   Depends on: 7
   Output: /Akamai/voice/data/pitches-raw-crepe-assisted/<algo short name>/<collection>/<song>/<voice>.txt
   Comments:
   This tool recomputes each non-Crepe algorithm estimate, forcing it to be within 20% of Crepe and within
   manual correction boxes.
   - one algorithm from Boersma, Maddox, Noll, Praat, Yin
   - output is pitches every 0.01sec in a song
   - BUG: no alignment of pitches: here we should use the previous alignment before comparing with Crepe
   - no masking of unvoiced "pitches"

   - The code is identical to Step 2.
   - The output data differs between .../pitches-raw/v-uv/... and .../pitches-raw-crepe-assisted/v-uv/....,
     probably because the code was updated and the output of this script is not used.

   Comments:
   This tool is used to create final pitch estimates and statistics ("confidence bounds")
   - does not align voices to each other within one song

!! Up to this point, all processing was per-voice.
   Now the voices aligned with each other.
   There was some experimentation: first I shifted the three voice parts to align, then I shifted
   all three to align with the mix.

   Comments:
   This tool shifts each voice to align with the mix. It optionally performs this task on
   pitch estimates, stats (mad), and/or pitch-override boxes.
