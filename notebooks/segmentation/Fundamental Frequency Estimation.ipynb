    "### Multiple Fundamental Frequency Estimation by Modeling Spectral Peaks and Non-Peak Region\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper by Duan, Pardo and Zhang presents a maximum-likelihood approach to estimating multiple fundamental frequencies (F0) when there is a mixture of harmonic sources. It uses a power spectogram of a time frame and assumes that the spectral peak and non-peak regions are in fact complimentary. The peaks help find F0s that have harmonics, and the non-peak regions help avoid F0s that have harmonics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters are learned from nonphonic and polyphonic training data. We are implimenting a greedy search strategy to estimate F0s one by one, to avoid the combinatorial problem of concurrent F0 estimation. It is an iterative process. It turns out that resynthesizing a harmonic sound using only peaks does little to change the human perception of the sound.\n",
