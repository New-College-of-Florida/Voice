    "This tool reads songs from /Akamai/voices/data/pitches-vuv-new. In this directory the Crepe pitch estimates are manually corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is used to create pitch-override boxes and to use note-detection to postprocess the Crepe pitch estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pitch-Override Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "The user creates one or more pitch-override boxes for each voice of each song. The tool writes the pitch-override boxes to /Akamai/voices/data/pitch-overrides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pitch-override box defines a min and max pitch in a range of time steps, as guidance for the other algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "In a section where the Crepe note is 0 the user can select either crepe pitches or note pitches. The tool will add\n",
    "a note whose pitch is the average of the Crepe pitches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Postprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-processing sets to -1 all pitches that are not assigned to notes or inter-note runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "On each song, the user should\n",
    "1. Run the manual override tool (the notebook Tool.ipynb) on each voice to check they're ready for pitch-override and postprocessing.\n",
    "2. Make pitch-override boxes for all three voices.\n",
    "3. Add notes and save the note files.\n",
    "4. Postprocess all three voices. (One click postprocesses all three voices.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The postprocessed pitch estimates are saved to /Akamai/voices/data/pitches-postprocessed."
