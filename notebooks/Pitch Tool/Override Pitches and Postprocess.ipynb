    "## Override Pitches with Range Boxes and Postprocess\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool reads songs from /Akamai/voices/data/pitches-vuv-new. In this directory the Crepe pitch estimates are manually corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is used to create pitch-override boxes and to use note-detection to postprocess the Crepe pitch estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pitch-Override Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "The user creates one or more pitch-override boxes for each voice of each song. The tool writes the pitch-override boxes to /Akamai/voices/data/pitch-overrides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pitch-override box defines a min and max pitch in a range of time steps, as guidance for the other algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "In a section where the Crepe note is 0 the user can select either crepe pitches or note pitches. The tool will add\n",
    "a note whose pitch is the average of the Crepe pitches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Postprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-processing sets to 0 all pitches whose note value is 0 and sets negative note values to -1.\n",
    "Generally long runs of nonzero pitches of indeterminate note are assigned a note of 0; this means either there is silence or (when there is an override box) Crepe's estimate should not be considered for the final estimate. \n",
    "Shorter runs between notes are assigned a negative note value; this means Crepe should not be used as guidance for the other algorithms but Crepe's estimate should be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "On each song, the user should\n",
    "1. Run the manual override tool (the notebook Tool.ipynb) on each voice to check they're ready for pitch-override and postprocessing.\n",
    "2. Make pitch-override boxes for all three voices.\n",
    "3. Toggle a 0 note to negative or vice-versa. See \"Postprocessing\" above.\n",
    "4. Add notes and save the note files. (One click saves the currently visible voice notes.)\n",
    "5. Postprocess all three voices. (One click postprocesses the currently visible voice.)\n",
    "6. Save all three voices. (One click saves the currently visible voice.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The postprocessed pitch estimates are saved to /Akamai/voices/data/pitches-postprocessed."
